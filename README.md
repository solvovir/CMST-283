Intro to Database systems. Prof Pritchard.
This was my first experience with databse systems. from conceptual to building actual databases in MS SQL. 

The first couple of weeks were spent working with DIA and seeing how a database in 'brainsotrmed' into a conceptual layout. The next several weeks were spent working directly with MS SQL Server.
I learned the basics of how SQL works and how to do a few basic queries and then extract the queried information into an Excel spreadsheet. I do not feel very confident working with SQL but would like to dive a little deeper into the syntax and manipulation of data withing SQL. Great class and overall enjoyed.
