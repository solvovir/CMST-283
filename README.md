CMST 103 assignments

this was an intro do javascript class. i enjoyed working with javascript more than the html. a few projects i had to get help with the syntax, but once i figured it out I tried to go beyoned just the assignment requirements and have fun with the visuals it would create. final project was quite difficult but Prof. Harding helped me very much turn my idea into syntax. 
codes are good references for future javascript projects
