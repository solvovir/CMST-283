entire class was done using Repl.it
COvered various topics including AJAX, MongoDB, Python
This was the most difficult coding class so far. All of the content was new to me and everything seemed to move very fast, but I was able to complete every assigment and felt confident with it once I was done. Coding seemed to get quite complicated at times but our Instructor did a good job explaining it with the instruction videos.
